<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles Vectors in 3-D Space.

The class use a homogeneous system of coordinates x, y and z
plus the component w (homogeneous coordinate) who will always be worth 0.0

An instance is constructed from two Vertex orig and dest:
new Vector( array( 'orig' => $VtxO, 'dest' => $Vtx1 ) );

If orig (origin point of the vector) is not specified then orig = (0, 0, 0)

Attributes are private, you may use getters (read only accessors)
setters are not available (no changes are permitted after the instance is created).

The class provides the following methods :

float magnitude() : returns the norm of the instantiated vector.

Vector normalize() : returns the correspondig normalized vector (a fresh copy
if the instance is already normalized).

Vector add( Vector $rhs ) : returns the result of the addition between the current instance and $rhs.

Vector sub( Vector $rhs ) : returns the result of the substraction between the current instance and $rhs.

Vector opposite() : returns the opposite vector.

Vector scalarProduct( $k ) : returns the product of the constant $k and the current instance.

Vector dotProduct( Vector $rhs ) : returns the scalar product of the current instance and $rhs.

Vector cos( Vector $rhs ) : returns the cosinus between the current instance and $rhs.

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs ) : return the cross product (right-handed set) of the current instance and $rhs
